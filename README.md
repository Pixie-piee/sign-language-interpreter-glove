# Smart Sign Language Interpreter Glove 

A hardware-based assistive technology project aimed at converting 
hand gestures into speech output for sign language users.

##  Objective
To design a wearable glove that detects hand gestures using flex sensors
and motion sensing, and outputs corresponding speech via an audio module.

##  Components Used
- Arduino Nano
- Flex Sensors (5)
- MPU6050 (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)
- DFPlayer Mini
- Speaker
- Custom PCB (designed in EasyEDA)

##  What I Have Done
- Designed complete schematic and PCB in EasyEDA
- Implemented voltage divider circuits for flex sensors
- Integrated audio output module in circuit design
- Ensured common grounding and correct power routing

##  Current Status
- PCB designed and finalized
- Gesture recognition logic planned (rule-based)
- Hardware implementation and testing pending

##  Future Scope
- Implement gesture classification (A–E)
- Integrate ML-based gesture recognition
- Add wireless communication
- Optimize for real-time accuracy
